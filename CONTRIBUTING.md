# Contributing Guidelines

Ah, a brave soul looking to contribute to ppCaption2Audio! We appreciate the courage. First and foremost, let's make sure you've had a cup of coffee, or tea, or any caffeinated beverage of your choice. You're gonna need it.

Before we get started, it's important to note that you should be having fun. If you're not having fun, then what's the point? If you're not laughing at your computer screen at least once an hour, you're doing it wrong!

## Guidelines for Submitting Code

### 1. Read the Code

First rule of Open Source Club: You need to read the code. And, unlike the Fight Club, you can and should talk about it!

### 2. Follow the Code Style

We like to think we've got style, even if it's just in the realm of code. Don't cramp our style. Indent with spaces, not tabs, unless we've indented with tabs. In that case, cramp our style, please. The point is: match the existing code style like you're its long lost twin!

### 3. Test your Code

This is a strictly "No 'YOLO' Pushing" zone. We don't push code that 'works on my machine'. If it can't pass the tests on all machines, it's dead to us. A bit harsh? Maybe. But the tests are there for a reason.

### 4. Document your Code

Document your code like you're Indiana Jones and it's the Holy Grail. We don't want to go on a treasure hunt to understand what your code is doing. But hey, if you've got a hat and a whip, who are we to stop you?

### 5. Create a Pull Request

So, you've made it this far, huh? Go ahead and create a pull request. We promise we don't bite... much. We appreciate your contribution and will review your PR as soon as we finish our current round of Fortnite.

## Reporting Bugs

We know, we know... our code has bugs? Shocking! Here's what you do when you find our little friends:

- Open an issue.
- Document the bug like it's a new species. Pictures are a plus. We like pictures.
- We will get to it when we're done arguing about whether the bug is a feature or not.

## Feature Requests

Want to add something new? Great! But we're going to need to be convinced it's a good idea. You can do this by opening an issue, writing a sonnet about your feature, or sending us chocolate. Hint: chocolate has a high success rate.

## Final Note

Remember: coding is a journey, not a destination. Also, it's okay to pull your hair out, talk to ducks, and cry. We've all been there. But hey, if you're not having fun, you're not doing it right!

Thanks for stopping by, and don't forget: the code is dark and full of errors!
